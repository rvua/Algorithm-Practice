// Predict what each of the following will return. Can we predict the variable random?

// Q.2 Dice Roller:
// Using what we've learned about the Math library in JavaScript, complete the following function that should return a value between 1 through 6 at random.
function d6() {
    // create a variable and assign a random decimal number between 0 and 1 to it.
    var roll = Math.random();
    // multiply by six to change the range. now we get a decimal number between 0 and 5.
    roll = roll * 6;
    // add one to roll, so our range is now a decimal number from 1 to 6.
    roll = roll + 1;
    // chop off that decimal number with Math.floor
    roll = Math.floor(roll);
    // all done! return our result.
    return roll;
}
  
var playerRoll = d6();
